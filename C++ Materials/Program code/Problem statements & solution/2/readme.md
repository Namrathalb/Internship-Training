Mahirl has given many suggestions to Baahubali and he gifted her a pearl chain. 
The chain is made of red pearls and green pearls. 
Mahirl likes chains in which the red pearls and green pearls alternate each other. 
So she wants to replace some of the pearls in the chain to suit her liking.

Let the red pearl be denoted as 'R' and let the green pearl be denoted as 'G'.
For example  'RGRGRGR' is a Chain of Mahirl's liking but  'RGTGRRG' is not.
Help Mahirl to calculate the minimum number of pearls she need to replace (ex. 'R' to 'G' or 'G' to 'R') to get a chain that she would like.
